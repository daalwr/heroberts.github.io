Suicide&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;NEEDS&amp;rdquo; project. Specifically I work on WP2, which examines the association between
depression and the environment along people&amp;rsquo;s daily space-time paths. More information on this project
is available &lt;a href="http://needs.sites.uu.nl/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Prior to starting this position I completed my PhD at the University of Leeds (UK) and Born in Bradford
(Bradford Institute for Health Research). My thesis was titled: &amp;ldquo;Development and evaluation of
environmental interventions on green space utilisation to promote health and well-being&amp;rdquo;.
The overall aim of the thesis was to provide evidence to inform the design of an environmental
intervention into green space use in order to promote health. It is openly accessible online
